# A Statement
# A statement is a single instruction to the computer,
print("Welcome!")  # This tells the computer to say Welcome.

# A Code
# A Code is a collection of statements that work together.
name = "Dodo"
print("Nice to meet you,", name)

# Memory Address
# It is where every variable stores data in a specific location in memory.
# it is like having a carbin with different drawers each labelled, one for pants, one for dresses, one for ties.
print("Memory address of 'name':", id(name))

# A Variable Name
# A variable is like a labeled box that holds data.
age = 10
print("Zara is", age, "years old.")

# Operator
# Operators perform actions like addition or comparison.
print("2 + 3 =", 2 + 3)  # '+' is the operator

# Operand 
# Operands are the values that operators act on.
# In 2 + 3, the operands are 2 and 3.

# Data Types
# They are lebels that tell python what kind of information you are working on
# like how you might lebel your spice jars. "cumin","garlic","royco"
# Python has different types of data:
number = 5           # Integer
word = "hello"       # String
truth = True         # Boolean
print("Data types:", type(number), type(word), type(truth))

# List of Values
# A list is a group of items stored together.
groceries = ["milk", "bread", "eggs"]
print("Grocery list:", groceries)

# Python Script vs Module
# A script is a python file you run to do something. 
# it is like pressing "play" on the playlist and music starts playing

# A module is like a toolbox. 
# It’s a file that contains Python code—functions, variables, and classes—that you can use in your own programs.
