#assuming your talking to a boda guy with primary seven knowledge;briefly explain the following with examples;
#a statement
#a code
#a memory address
#a variable name
#an operator
#an operand
#datatype
#a list of values
#a python script/module

#A STATEMENT
#is a single complete instruction to a computer.(eg salary=2000)
print("no long talk")
#this will tell the computer to say "no long talk"

#A CODE
#a code is a group of statements which is written to do something 
#code is just like instructions,you write it to tell the computer what to do just like someone tells you where to go and what to carry
print("i will save some money today to buy a helmet")
print("i will stop working at 6pm")

#A MEMORY ADDRESS
#this is like a house address but here the computer keeps things there
#for example if you have left your boda jacket at the stage in a box number 209,in computers that number is the memory address where data is stored.

#A VARIABLE NAME
#this is like a name used to store something in a computer,it shouldnt start with a number ,it shouldnt have spaces,it shouldnt start with capital letters as well.
#its like a label you give to something so that the computer can remember it and use it later 
#for example evening=200000

#AN OPERATOR
#a symbol or word or character that tells a computer what to do with a value. symbols include(+,-,*,/,//,%)
#it has many categories which include mathematical.assignment,comparison,logical,and special
#just like the road signs tel you what to do
#for example if you made 20000 in the morning,30000 in the evening and you want to add them you say;
print(20000+30000)
#it will give you the total...you just have to keep changing the symbols to get the value you want

#AN OPERAND
#this is simply a value.
# for example 150000+450000
#150000 and 450000 are operands/values/numbers

#DATATYPES
#more like values to be stored in the memory of a computer,it shows the kind of value your working with
#for example 500 is a number which is called integer in python
#"benitah" is a text/string which is normally in quotes
animals["dog","cat","goat"]
#that is a list

#A LIST OF VALUES
#this is like a group of items you write down and is stored in square brackets separated by commas.
my_fruits["apples","orange","mango","strawberries"]

#A PYTHON SCRIPT/MODULE
#a file of python code with an extension of .py
#its like a guidebook or notebook where you write down alll the steps for something you want the computer to do
